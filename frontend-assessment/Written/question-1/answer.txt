My approach for this design is to have the “Most Popular” section as a separate heading with a border at the bottom. Below that, there will be a parent container with two divs: one on the left and one on the right. The left div will take up 70% of the width and contain regular content. The images inside will have the same max-width and max-height for a consistent look. The right div will take up 30% of the width and be styled with flex-direction: column. Each item in the right div will have a bottom border, except the last one.

Some challenges I might face are making sure the 70/30 layout stays responsive on different screen sizes and making the design look the same across all browsers. I’ll use proper layout techniques like flexbox or grid, add spacing for better readability, and make sure everything is accessible, including contrast, image alt text, and keyboard navigation to ensure everything works properly.

When I was in 1st year, we had a project in Introduction to Web, and I had a hard time making my website responsive. The layout didn’t work well on small screens and I didn’t know what to do. Tito Nohj helped me and we watched YouTube videos together to fix it. We learned about flexbox and media queries and slowly made the website better. I learned that it’s okay to ask for help and to take time to understand things.

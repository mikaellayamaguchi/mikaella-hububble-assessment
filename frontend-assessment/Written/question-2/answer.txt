The .hidden-div should be invisible, but it’s not because the .section .div style is overriding it.

The comment about the blue underline at line 30 isn’t working, maybe the style isn’t applied correctly.

The title of the list should be placed outside the <ul>, not inside it.

There's also no <!DOCTYPE html> on top.
